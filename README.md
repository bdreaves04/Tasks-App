Project Title: Task Management System

Description:
Create a web-based task management system that allows users to organize and track their tasks efficiently. The system should support features such as:

    - User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
    - Task Creation: Users should be able to create tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority level, and category (e.g., work, personal, study).
    - Task Organization: Provide users with options to organize tasks into different projects or categories. They should be able to assign tasks to specific projects or categories for better management.
    - Task Status Tracking: Allow users to track the status of their tasks (e.g., pending, in progress, completed). Implement features such as checkboxes or progress bars to visualize task completion.
    - Deadline Reminders: Implement notifications or reminders to alert users of approaching task deadlines.
    - Collaboration: Allow users to share tasks or entire projects with collaborators. Collaborators should be able to view, edit, and update shared tasks.
    - Search and Filter: Enable users to search for specific tasks or filter tasks based on criteria such as due date, priority, category, etc.
    - User Dashboard: Provide users with a personalized dashboard where they can see an overview of their tasks, upcoming deadlines, and any notifications.

Technologies:
You can use the following technologies to build this project:

    - Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular)
    - Backend: Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails
    - Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
    - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth
    - Hosting: AWS, Heroku, Firebase
    - Additional Tools: Bootstrap or Materialize CSS (for UI/UX), Moment.js (for date/time manipulation)

Optional Features:
Enhance your project with additional features such as:

    - Recurring Tasks: Allow users to create tasks that repeat on a regular schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    - Kanban Board: Implement a Kanban-style board for users to visualize their tasks' workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
    - Time Tracking: Enable users to track the time spent on each task and generate reports on their productivity.
    - Integration with Calendar: Integrate with popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) to sync task deadlines and events.
    - Mobile App: Develop a mobile app version of the task management system using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.

Learning Opportunities:
This project will allow you to gain experience in full-stack web development, database management, user authentication, and collaboration features. You'll also learn about task organization methodologies like Kanban and how to implement them in a digital environment. Additionally, you'll explore user interface design principles and learn how to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for productivity applications.
